Files:
- lab4c_tcp.c: A C source file that compiles to a program that implements part 1 of this lab: connected to a server over TCP and reading/writing data.
- lab4c_tls: A C source file that compiles to a program that implements part 12of this lab: connected to a server over SSL/TLS and reading/writing data.
- Makefile: a Makefile with the commands defined by the spec.
- README: This README!

Notes:
- I found that only the function TLSv1_client_method() allowed me to connect to the server via TLS, so I went with that.
- The spec did not specify anything about error messages, so I did not include any.
- I had to run `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev` to get the programs to compile on my beaglebone.
